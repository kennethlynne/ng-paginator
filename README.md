ng-paginator-plz
========================

Angular pagination library that handles pagination non-intrusively.
It provides you with the paginated data and some controlls to navigate in the data,
it's up to you to handle listing of data.

# Install:
Download zip, or use bower

```
bower install ng-paginate-plz --save
```

Add `ng-paginate-plz` as a dependancy to your module.
```javascript
angular.module('yourApp', 'ngPaginatorPlz')
```
# Usage:
Provide some data in an array:

```javascript
$scope.data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
```

```html
<paginator data="data" page-size="5" export-paged-data-to="targetVariable"></paginator>

<ul>
    <li ng-repeat="row in targetVariable">{{row}}</li>
</ul>
```

Now the provided data will be paginated and the currently visible data is exported into `targetVariable`.
It is up to you to list this data.

## Parameters:
1.  data: data to be paginated. Must be an array.
2.  page-size: items per page, defaults to 20
3.  export-paged-data-to: variable to export current page data. Must be an array.

angular.module('yourApp')
  .value('DefaultPaginatorTemplate', 'views/custom-paginator.html')
```
